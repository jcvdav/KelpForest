 Etymology: The genus name comes from the Greek <i>za</i>, meaning intensive, and <i>pteryx</i>, meaning fin, in reference to the vertical fins being larger than those of skates. The species name comes from Latin, meaning made rough, in reference to the numerous stellate prickles on its back. (Ref. 48844)."

The species name comes from Latin, meaning made rough, in reference to the numerous stellate prickles on its back. (Ref. 48844)."

 Etymology: The genus name comes from the Greek <i>za</i>, meaning intensive, and <i>pteryx</i>, meaning fin, in reference to the vertical fins being larger than those of skates. The species name comes from Latin, meaning made rough, in reference to the numerous stellate prickles on its back. (Ref. 48844)."

 Etymology: The genus name comes from the Greek <i>za</i>, meaning intensive, and <i>pteryx</i>, meaning fin, in reference to the vertical fins being larger than those of skates. The species name comes from Latin, meaning made rough, in reference to the numerous stellate prickles on its back. (Ref. 48844)."

The species name comes from Latin, meaning made rough, in reference to the numerous stellate prickles on its back. (Ref. 48844)."

The species name comes from Latin, meaning made rough, in reference to the numerous stellate prickles on its back. (Ref. 48844)."
